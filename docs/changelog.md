## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-20

### 🎉 Major Features

#### macOS ScreenCaptureKit Backend (Official Support)
- **Added** ScreenCaptureKit backend for macOS 13.0+ (Ventura and later)
- **Apple Silicon Compatible**: No AMFI/SIP hacks required
- **Simple Permissions**: Screen Recording only (no Microphone/TCC complexity)
- **BundleID-Based Capture**: Automatically converts PID to bundleID
- **Low Latency**: ~10-15ms audio capture performance
- **Stable API**: Uses official Apple ScreenCaptureKit framework

### Changed

#### macOS Backend Architecture
- **ScreenCaptureKit is now the RECOMMENDED backend** for macOS
- PyObjC backend moved to fallback (has IOProc callback issues)
- Swift CLI helper and C extension moved to `experimental/` directory
- macOS support upgraded from "Experimental" to "Officially Supported"

#### Project Structure
- **Relocated Swift helper**: Moved from `swift/proctap-macos/` to `src/proctap/swift/screencapture-audio/`
- **Added MANIFEST.in**: Ensures Swift helper is included in source distributions
- **Archive directory**: Created `archive/apple-silicon-investigation-20251120/` for historical investigation docs

### Fixed

#### Type Safety
- Resolved all mypy type errors across the codebase
- Fixed type hints in macOS backends (ScreenCaptureKit, PyObjC, Native)
- Improved type annotations for better IDE support and static analysis

### Documentation

#### New Documentation
- **macOS Investigation Archive**: Comprehensive AMFI/SIP investigation docs in `archive/`
- **C Extension Investigation**: Detailed findings in `docs/experimental/c_extension_investigation/`
- **Implementation Summaries**: Session summaries and TCC implementation guides

#### Updated Documentation
- README.md: Updated platform support table (macOS now "Officially Supported")
- CLAUDE.md: Updated macOS backend information and recommendations
- CI/CD workflows: Updated for ScreenCaptureKit backend builds

### Technical Details

#### Backend Selection Priority (macOS)
1. **ScreenCaptureKit** (Recommended - macOS 13+)
2. **PyObjC** (Fallback - has IOProc callback issues)
3. **Swift CLI / C Extension** (Archived - experimental only)

#### Build System
- CI/CD workflows configured for ScreenCaptureKit backend
- Swift helper automatically built during installation (if Swift toolchain available)
- No breaking changes to existing Windows/Linux backends

### Migration Guide

#### For macOS Users
If you were using experimental backends:
- **Recommended**: Switch to ScreenCaptureKit backend (default in v0.4.0)
- **Requirements**: macOS 13.0+ and Screen Recording permission
- **No code changes needed**: Existing code works with new backend
- **Bundle ID capture**: Automatically handles PID → bundleID conversion

#### Breaking Changes
- None for Windows/Linux users
- macOS: Experimental Swift CLI moved to `experimental/` (still available but not recommended)
